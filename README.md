# BattleShift

An API for multi-player battleship. This is a brownfield project built on top of a pre-existing battleship game for a single player and computer. Players can register for an account, and will receive an email with their API key and a link to activate their account. Once activated, they are able to send post requests using their API key to create a new game, place their ships and fire shots on the opposing player.  Both players must be registered users.
